# My Awesome Project

This is a project I put together, because I love cats, and wanted an application that would show me all the different breeds of cats, all in one area, as well as have something to send to a friend, so they can experience the joy of cats as well.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

The main part of this project is vanilla JavaScript with a little bit of HTML, and a sprinkle of CSS to make it look decent. I set down a basically style for the project with HTML, and CSS, and spent the majority of the time messing with the [Cat Api](https://thecatapi.com/)

## Optimizations

- It could definitely look better, in the future I'd like to clean up the design of the page to make it more appealing.
- I would love to add more characteristics for each breed.
- Implimentation of an Overall "Is this cat right for you" based on an average of it's numbers.
- Comparing user input vs cat characteristics, to see if this cat is good in their household based on what they have (dogs, children, doesn't like shedding, etc)

## Lessons Learned:

This project helped me dig deeper into the dismantling of APIs and how to pull information from them. I was stuck for a bit with the idea of how to grab both images, and text at the same time, which resulted in multiple fetch requests instead of using one fetch, and pulling different pieces of data from the response.
