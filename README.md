Write a short sentence or two about this project and what it does. Be sure to include a link and a screenshot (we're front end devs so we can actually see our work!).

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

The main part of this project is vanilla JavaScript with a little bit of HTML, and a sprinkle of CSS to make it look decent. I set down a basically style for the project with HTML, and CSS, and spent the majority of the time messing with the Cat Api (https://thecatapi.com/)

## Optimizations

It could definitely look better, in the future I'd like to clean up the design of the page to make it more appealing.
I would love to add more characteristics for each breed.
Implimentation of an Overall "Is this cat right for you" based on an average of it's numbers.
Comparing user input vs cat characteristics, to see if this cat is good in their household based on what they have (dogs, children, doesn't like shedding, etc)

## Lessons Learned:

This project helped me dig deeper into the dismantling of APIs and how to pull information from them. I was stuck for a bit with the idea of how to grab both images, and text at the same time, which resulted in multiple fetch requests instead of using one fetch, and pulling different pieces of data from the response.

## Examples:

Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
